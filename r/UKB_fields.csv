Nature 590, 290-299 (2021) ~Ehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03205-y~ <br> <br>After phasing the UK Biobank genetic data (carried out on 81 chromosomal chunks using Eagle v.2.4), the phased data were converted from GRCh37 to GRCh38 using LiftOver. Imputation was performed using Minimac4 v1.0.2 (~Ehttps://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4~). The reference panel is the TOPMed R2 panel, which is available to public at ~Ehttps://imputation.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov~. Imputation was performed in 1Mb chunks and merged back together by chromosome. Due to large data size, markers with poor imputation were not retained (excluded Minimac4 imputation quality metric R^2 < 0.1). Across all the chromosomes, 677,037 markers were used for imputation. <br>For distribution to UK Biobank, output Minimac4 VCF files were converted to BGEN format using qctool v2.0.8. The conversion used the Genotype Probability (GP) field from source VCF and the probabilities are stored using 8 bit precision. <br> <br>Details on contributing cohorts for the TOPMed Imputataion Panel can be seen in Extended Table 3 of Sequencing of 53,831 diverse genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed Program.

So before they could be combined the measurements had to be transformed to make them compatible. For example, if the height of something had been measured in metres and the weight in kilograms it would not make sense simply to add them together. <p> Income and employment were classed as the most important factors, and they were given the biggest weighting in the overall index.

The SIMD combines data from seven distinct domains or topic areas all of which are considered to be important contributors to deprivation levels. These domains have remained the same as in the previous version of the index, published in 2006, and the data used in compiling each one is the most appropriate and up to date that was available at the time of constructing the index. <p> The SIMD is a relative measure of deprivation that uses 6,505 data zones across Scotland as its unit of comparison. The rank applied to each of these data zones identifies each as being more or less deprived than all the others in the country. The rankings run from 1 being the most deprived to 6505 being the least deprived. Therefore the smaller the ranking the more deprived the data zone. As the SIMD is a relative measure it cannot show how much more deprived one data zone is than another, e.g. that a data zone ranked 5 is twice as deprived as a data zone ranked 10. In the same way the distance between each ranking can vary - so the gap between the data zones ranked 16 and 17 could be very small while the gap between those ranked 17 and 18 could be much bigger. <p> The SIMD can be used to identify the small areas with the highest concentrations of multiple deprivation in Scotland using either the overall index or the individual domains. The most commonly used cut off levels are 10%, 15% or 20% - although different cut offs may be required depending on individual policy or organisational focus.",2018-05-02T00:00:00,2018-07-06T00:00:00,35845,35845,0,1,1,1
